Cartesian directory - 
1. simulations.py - has the files for which I have run simualtions to get to a steady state to inverse for viscosity later
2. forward.py - has the DT calcuation (Actual)
3. inversion.py - Calculation of isoviscous DT, Cost function, reduced functional, Taylor's tests and finally the optimisation

Cylindrical Directory- Similar but for the cylyndrical cases.
